# Tableau Summary: Airline Analysis

## Overview
This Tableau visualization provides a comprehensive analysis of airline departure delays, examining delay causes, airline performance metrics, and flight operations across different carriers.

## Key Findings

### Delay Causes Analysis
The visualization reveals significant variations in delay causation:
- **Most Common Delay**: Late aircraft arrivals represent the primary source of departure delays
- **Least Common Delay**: Security-related issues cause the fewest departure delays

### Airline Performance Comparison
Average delay times show substantial differences across carriers:
- **Worst Performance**: Hawaiian Airlines Inc. with an average delay of 22.7 minutes
- **Best Performance**: Virgin America with the lowest average delay of 13.1 minutes
- **Performance Range**: Nearly 10-minute difference between best and worst performing airlines

### Flight Operations Metrics
The analysis highlights interesting contrasts in airline operations:
- **Highest Volume Carrier**: Southwest Airlines Co. leads in both total distance flown and flight count
- **Average Distance Leader**: Virgin America achieves the highest average mileage per flight despite lower overall volume

## Business Implications
This visualization provides valuable insights for:
- Airlines seeking to improve operational efficiency
- Passengers making carrier selection decisions
- Industry analysts comparing airline performance
- Airport operations teams understanding delay patterns

The data suggests that flight volume doesn't necessarily correlate with delay performance, as demonstrated by Virgin America's superior metrics in both delay times and flight efficiency despite lower overall flight counts.
